# Github Issues Showcase Project &middot; [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/SparkCode/github_issues.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/SparkCode/github_issues)
It's an SPA for viewing issues from the selected repository on Github.
## Fulfilled requirements: 
1. Searching issues by user and repository name. The input field for repository name should have autocomplete. Each issue should display with number, name and open date. Need an opportunity to share a search result page.
2. Paging for issues
3. Showing messages: "loading issues", "issues not be found", "issues not be loaded" etc.
5. Viewing an issue on the different page
6. Tests for components / reducers / action creators
## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
